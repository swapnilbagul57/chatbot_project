On receiving a mail or message with link to your bank website, please confirm it with the bank officials.  6. If a transaction fails and a stranger offers you help of any kind, please restrain from accepting the same.  7. Change your Credit card PIN every three months.  8.

Also learn about the privacy settings. I would suggest you disable the options to search you thorugh E-mail ID and Phone no.  3. Be prudent about making friends online. Look through the account before accepting friend request.  Avoid making unneccesary friends and disable the option to view friendlist.  3. Turn off the active status in Messenger. (This however will prevent you from detecting when your contacts are active on Messenger).  4. Report abusive behaviour and contents on FB as and when you see them."],
